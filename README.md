# getdata_project: How this script works?

1. If there is no file with the name "UCI HAR Dataset" in the current working directory, this script will automactically download the data and unzip it to a folder namely "UCI HAR Dataset". If you already have the folder "UCI HAR Dataset" unzipped in your working directory, please make sure that you have not removed or changed any data files.
2. You should have packages "plyr" and "dplyr" installed in order to run this script
3. Each step in the script starts with ## (for example, step 3. "Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set" starts with ##3. )
