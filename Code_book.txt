This code book describes the variables used in the script "run_analysis.R"
The variables are described in order of appearance as in the script and the steps.
For example, in step 1. "Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set", there are 3 variables: Xy_train, Xy_test and Xy_train_test.
----------------------
Read data
The variables in this section have similar names as its data files name.
For example, data in the file "X_train.txt" is read as X_train
There are 8 files to be read
----------------------
Step 1.
Xy_train: Merged data of subject_train, y_train and X_train by columns (used cbind())
Xy_test: Merged data of subject_test, y_test and X_test by columns
Xy_train_test: Merged data of the training and test data sets
----------------------
Step 2.
col_mean_std: vector index of variables whose name includes "mean", "Mean" or "std"
Xy_train_test_ext: Data with only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
There are several temporary variables in this section: Xy_train_test_temp, Xy_train_test_ext_temp 
----------------------
Step 3.
There is no new variable
----------------------
Step 4.
There is no new variable
----------------------
Step 5.
average_table: final data of this step, containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (from 3rd column). The first 2 columns are Subject and Activity
table_ij: a subset of Xy_train_test_ext in Step 2 for given Suject and given Activity
value_average: row vector of the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The first 2 values are Subject and Activity
names_average: row vector of the names of the average of each variable. For example, the average of the variable "tBodyAcc-mean()-X " will have the name "Average- tBodyAcc-mean()-X "
----------------------
Read the output file: data<-read.table("data_course_project.txt", header = TRUE)
